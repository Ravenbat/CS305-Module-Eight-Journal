Portfolio in Software Security
## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

My client was a financial consulting company that developes individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They wanted me to address security matters and concerns as part of their modern operations and software.

## What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I analyzed their software's plugins and APIs very well. Lots of plugins were dependent on another plugin and these dependencies could have been exploited by attackers and hackers for breaching. Secure code is very important to protect against vulnerabilities that attackers can take advantage of.

Software security helps keep company's overall operations going smoothly and safely. If their data is attacked it can disrupt their operations and affect clients greatly.

## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
Trying to gather all vulnerabilities in one document was very challenging especially in easy to understand format. I found out that focusing on big vulnerabilities first and branching out from there helps.

## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I approached it with "balanced" approach. Meaning I looked at both factors of using more secure algorithms and compatibility of it with existing software and data. Balance between more secure and compatibility. If it is very secure but hard to adopt, I will go for more compatible security algorithm encryptions.

## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I used existing method of running dependency check and testing the application to see if I introduced new vulnerabilities. It is very convenient tool to factor if I'm making good progress. Repeated testing of the application helps ensure my refactored code didn't hinder it's functionality.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used Dependency check and repeated executions to test the software. As for coding practice, I found trying to use plugin, API and writing as less cluttered code is really helpful.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would showcase my work of using Algorithm cipher checksum generation as I have implementeed and used algorithm encryption of SHA-512.
